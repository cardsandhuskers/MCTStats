## Points Balancing
### Overview
This Python script uses past performance of MCC-style mini games in order to balance the total amount of points that each game awards. Most games use integrals calculus to create a model of the points that should be awarded, based on the number of players in the tournament, as well as game-dependent variables.

### Overview
This python script takes the raw CSVs generated by the game and converts them into better tables, with the points earned 
each game (including multipliers), the multiplier for each game, and the total points (with multiplier) and total raw 
points (no multiplier).
